      <description>Prologue Last week, I alongside with 3 other Indian Students, Sejal, anikait and Rajarshi represented India to participate in GCC 2024 at Thailand. We had an amazing experience representing our country at the Global Cybersecurity Camp (GCC) 2024 in Thailand. This blog isn&amp;rsquo;t about the technical nitty-gritty, but rather about the incredible memories and fun we had during that unforgettable week.
A big shoutout to VueNow and Traboda for sponsoring this amazing trip!</description>
